			<a name="contact">Contact information</a>
		</h2>
		As described in the <a href="disclaimer.html" target="_blank">site policy</a>
		this is a privately operated web site. I programmed this stuff in my
		spare time and will (unfortunately) only be able to maintain all that
		in my spare time, too. Nevertheless I will take care about your requests
		as good as possible for sure. You can aim them to me or my friends who
		support me the following ways:
		<ul>
			<li>via in-game-message</li>
			<li>via mail to <a href="mailto:syncnapsis@syncnapsis.com">syncnapsis@syncnapsis.com</a></li>
			<li>via pinboard</li>
		</ul>
		Unfortunately I cannot promise we will always have time to treat your
		requests immediately. So if it takes some time once more, please don't
		become desperate: We'll stay on the ball...

		<h2>
			<a name="sitenotice">Site notice</a>
		</h2>
		I seem to be obliged to disclose who is operating this site...
		But since I don't necessarily want to shout out my address loudly,
		I aks you to use the contact possibilities mentioned above as far as
		possible.<br/> If then there is still a reason for complaint, you can still
		have a look at <a href="www.denic.de">DENIC</a> to find out who owns
		syncnapsis.com. I finally can't do anything against that...
