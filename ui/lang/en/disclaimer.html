		<h1>Legal stuff</h1>
		I am not a jurist, but nevertheless there are some rules for this
		site!
		<ul class="listing">
			<li><a href="#sitepolicy">Site policy</a></li>
			<li><a href="#disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>
			<a name="sitepolicy">Site policy</a>
		</h2>
		<ol type="I">
			<li>For the legal stuff there are two things most important:
				<ol>
					<li>The <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a></li>
					<li>When you register for this site you accept the following
						site policy</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>I (or syncnapsis.com) won't guarantee anything. Neither the
				availabilty of the site, nor any other services... As long as
				our provider plays along with us everything's well, but if
				something isn't running smoothly once in a while, I can't do
				better than trying to fix ist. And I hope it should be obvious
				for all	of you, this won't always be possible within a few minutes!
			</li>
			<li>Please do never forget: this is just a game!<br />
				This means a good etiquette always comes first. Abusing, illegal,
				racist, discriminating oder pornographic content has nothing to
				do here und I repudiate that until I removed that content.
				Please help me dealing with that, too, if something catches
				your eye: 4 eyes can see more than 2, 6 more than 4 and so on...  
			</li>
			<li>The nature of a browser game is to collect, save and analyse
				user interactions. Therefore you got to get used to the fact
				there will probably more data acquired and stored than obvious
				from first sight. Of course we will treat this data privately
				and will only use them for internal purposes. This will include
				for example:
				<ul>
					<li>the game itself</li>
					<li>maintenance stuff</li>
					<li>statistic analysis</li>
				</ul> If you want your data to be deleted, this of course is
				your basic right, but unfortunately this just technically won't
				be possible without restrictions! I can therefore only offer to
				remove that data as good as possible or to anonymize it if you
				desire.
			</li>
			<li>The e-mail address you have to enter on registration of course
				is not just used to identify you as a real person: I want to
				make you contactable! This won't mean, I will spam you with
				advertisement and notifications, but it may be senseful or required
				to send you a message once in a while. Reasons might be:
				<ul>
					<li>notifications concerning the availability of the site</li>
					<li>notifications concerning changes of the site</li>
					<li>delivery of messages from other users</li>
					<li>administrative messages</li>
					<li>game related notifications</li>
				</ul> 
				Currently we aren't so far, but in the future there shall be an
				option in your profile for managing notifications settings. Until
				this is done, please stay patient.
			</li>
			<li>For everything you post in the context of the site of course has
				your copyright somehow, regardless wether we talk about
				<ul>
					<li>comments & statements on the pinboard, in the form etc.</li>
					<li>match title</li>
					<li>content designed by you like galaxies / maps and their names</li>
					<li>a lot more that comes to your mind</li>
				</ul> Nevertheless you should be aware of the fact those statements
				are open to public and I don't want to here or read I was using
				your creative work for the site without you being asked. This includes
				linking, quoting or bringing that content into the game	in any other
				way. That's why that content indeed is your intellectual property, 
				but you will grant unrestricted and free right of use for all that
				content in the context of operating the site or game to me and/or
				syncnapsis.com.    
			</li>
			<li>If somebody thinks he has to step out of the line by breaking the
				rules badly I reserve right to ban and kick him/her and never talk
				to him/her again.</li>
			<li>I programmed this all in my spare time and will (unfortunately) only
				be able to maintain it in my spare time, too. So if something isn't
				working as desired, I am very sorry, but even me isn't without fail
				;-) Notifications about bugs or new feature requests are willingly
				accepted and in the future there shall be a seperate area just for
				that. Unfortunately I cannot promise I will realize those things
				and if so I can't predict when I will be able to do it... But you
				can be sure I'm always with you, when it comes to improving all
				that!</li>
			<li>If you receive the impression the game is unfair, there are
				always two possibilities:
				<ol>
					<li>you discovered a bug - give it to me!</li>
					<li>it simply just happend by chance, get used to it</li>
				</ol> 
				But the most important thing counting is:
			</li>
			<li>Never forget: It is a game and we all just want to have fun! 
			 	</li>
